# Multilingual Chatbot with integrated Image Generation

# Introduction
A Multilingual Text to Image Generator Chatbot is developed utilizing Streamlit, OpenAI's GPT-3.5, and Clarifai's image recognition API. Users are empowered to input text in their chosen language, subsequently translated into English. The translated text acts as a cue for GPT-3.5 to craft a response. This response then directs the generation of an image corresponding to the input text, enabling a versatile and intuitive multilingual interaction with image generation functionality.
